    This fitness function has two independent beams which go through a single filter each. It is
    assumed that these beams are parallel and have the same linear polarisation angle before starting.
    The input variables for this function are:
    - E theta
    - B field 1
    - Temp 1
    - B theta 1
    - B phi 1
    - B field 2
    - Temp 2
    - B theta 2
    - B phi 2
    - B field 3
    - Temp 3
    - B theta 3
    - B phi 3
    After the filter, the electric fields are combined additively (hence being naive), and pass through a final filter and a polariser
    which is perpendicular to the input polarisation to ensure a convergent integral.
